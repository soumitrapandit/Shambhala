POV: YASH

He woke up with an ache in his lower abdomen. 

He tried to crouch in his bed to see the wound but couldn't muster the strength.
Still, he managed to see the tops of his bandages that coiled around his torso and could see
them turning a deep crimson. 

He didn't bother to alert anyone. He just laid back down and resigned himself to his fate.

He was woken up again by the boy dabbing at his wounds. Apparently, he had passed out. 

Vijay was the boy's name, he'd learned. 

He liked Vijay - he always had a silly smile and a friendly cadence about him.

Yash estimated that he was about eleven or twelve but short for his age, pudgy and happy go lucky.
Yash had noticed that like all other children of the Village, Vijay wore the same set of clothes everyday. A round neck tee with large
alternating stripes of blue and green that reminded him of the sandman from Spiderman and faded blue shorts.
Old, but clean ankle length socks and black leather school shoes - much like the ones Yash had himself worn
in his school days. 

Vijay also sported a well oiled combover that made him look really homely. And by all estimates, he probably was. 

In another life, perhaps, they could have been friends.

But not here.

Vijay spoken with a broken vocabulary. His english often missed articles and he confused pronouns - 
quite a common artefact of non native speakers but what Yash found interesting was that he didn't speak
the local dialect very well either.

That fact almost always disturbed him - he dreaded to think that a child could be born in this place. 

No, no, not here. Anywhere but here. No child should have to endure that. 

Vijay noticed that he was up and smiled at him. 

"Don't worry, the doctor is on his way."

And he went back to working on his bandages.
